## How Local SEO Works

Local SEO is different from broad SEO in that it focuses on three core areas: **Relevance, Prominence, and Proximity**.

The chart below shows the factors that influence lead generation for local businesses in Utah.

![pie chart showing the factors of local SEO lead generation](/media/image.png)Source: Percentages are based on the average percentages given by ChatGPT (o4-mini-high) and Gemini (2.5 Flash) after performing Deep Research. Their results differed by an average of 6 percentage points for each of the factors.

## 1\. Relevance

Relevance is how well your content aligns with what the user is searching for. When setting up your website and/or blog, we want each page to match search intent. We do this by researching the keywords your customers are using and aligning them with your offerings. For local SEO, we also use location-based modifiers targeting a specific city or region. This helps you rank higher in that area and shows customers that your content is relevant to their needs. The title tag and H1 tag are the clearest indicators to Google of what your webpage is about. Your other headings and content should support these tags and add depth.

On your Google Business Profile (GBP), your relevance is determined primarily by your primary category (this is the most critical relevance signal). Other relevance factors include:

*   Secondary categories
    
*   Business name
    
*   Services/products listed
    
*   Your website content, which Google uses to assess GBP relevance
    

## 2\. Prominence

Prominence is the authority of your content. For websites and blogs, it's heavily influenced by the quantity and quality of backlinks, citations, and social shares. Links act as popularity votes in the eyes of Google. While all quality (non-spammy) backlinks are helpful, local backlinks from businesses or people in your area are the most impactful. They tie your website/blog to your target location.

Another factor that influences the prominence of your website/blog is technical SEO, which focuses on the structure and performance of your website/blog:

*   Faster load times: Improves user experience and rankings
    
*   Mobile-friendly design: Google prioritizes this
    
*   Clear structure: Helps search engines crawl and index effectively
    

For your Google Business Profile, prominence is determined by how engaging your profile is to the public, the number of reviews you have, and your average rating. The top three GBP listings often appear above websites in local searches, making it a powerful tool.

## 3\. Proximity

Proximity refers to how close a potential customer is to your business. You'll naturally rank higher in search results for users who are physically closer to your Utah location. However, high relevance and prominence can extend your reach.

## Analytics

SEO rank tracking tools and Google Analytics are essential for understanding what's working in your SEO strategy.

You'll be able to see:

*   How you rank for specific keywords
    
*   Which pages are the most popular
    
*   Where your traffic is coming from (search, social, direct, etc.)
    
*   Where your users are located
    

## Summary

Relevance, prominence, and proximity are the three pillars of local SEO. Your website, blog, and Google Business Profile are the most powerful tools you have. When combined with SEO rank tracking tools and analytics, you'll know where to improve and grow.

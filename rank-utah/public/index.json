SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the process of optimizing your website to rank higher in search engine results when users search for keywords related to your business or services.\nLocal SEO is different from broad SEO and focuses on three core areas: Relevance, Prominence, and Proximity.\nThe chart below shows the factors that influence lead generation for local businesses.\nSource: Percentages are based on the average percentages given by ChatGPT (o4-mini-high) and Gemini (2.5 Flash) after performing Deep Research. Their results differed by an average of 6 percentage points for each of the factors.\n1. Relevance üîç Relevance is how well your content aligns with what the user is searching for. When setting up your website, we want each page to match search intent. We do this by researching the keywords your customers are using and aligning them with your offerings. For local SEO, we also use location-based modifiers targeting a specific city or region. This helps you rank higher in that area and shows customers that your content is relevant to their needs. The title tag and H1 tag are the clearest indicators to Google of what your webpage is about. Your other headings and content should support these tags and add depth.\nOn your Google Business Profile (GBP), your relevance is determined primarily by your primary category (this is the most critical relevance signal). Other relevance factors include:\nSecondary categories Business name Services/products listed Your website content, which Google uses to assess GBP relevance 2. Prominence üîó Prominence is the authority of your content. For websites, it\u0026rsquo;s heavily influenced by the quantity and quality of backlinks, citations, and social shares. Links act as popularity votes in the eyes of Google. While all quality (non-spammy) backlinks are helpful, local backlinks from businesses or people in your area are the most impactful. They tie your website to your target location.\nAnother factor that influences the prominence of your website is technical SEO, which focuses on the structure and performance of your website:\nFaster load times: Improves user experience and rankings Mobile-friendly design: Google prioritizes this Clear structure: Helps search engines crawl and index effectively For your Google Business Profile, prominence is determined by how engaging your profile is to the public, the number of reviews you have, and your average rating. The top three GBP listings often appear above websites in local searches, making it a powerful tool.\n3. Proximity üìç Proximity refers to how close a potential customer is to your business. You\u0026rsquo;ll naturally rank higher in search results for users who are physically closer to your location. However, high relevance and prominence can extend your reach.\nAnalytics üìà SEO rank tracking tools and Google Analytics are essential for understanding what\u0026rsquo;s working in your SEO strategy.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see:\nHow you rank for specific keywords Which pages are the most popular Where your traffic is coming from (search, social, direct, etc.) Where your users are located Summary Relevance, prominence, and proximity are the three pillars of local SEO. Your website and Google Business Profile are two of the most powerful tools you have. When combined with SEO rank tracking tools and analytics, you\u0026rsquo;ll know where to improve and grow.\nLet Me Help You! üòä If you need help with your SEO marketing please reach out.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/utah-seo-marketing/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-local-seo\"\u003eWhat is Local SEO?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSEO, or \u003cem\u003eSearch Engine Optimization\u003c/em\u003e, is the process of optimizing your website to rank higher in search engine results when users search for keywords related to your business or services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocal SEO is different from broad SEO and focuses on three core areas: \u003cstrong\u003eRelevance, Prominence, and Proximity\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chart below shows the factors that influence lead generation for local businesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Local SEO Lead-Generation Factors Pie Chart\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/images/uploads/image.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Utah SEO Marketing"},{"content":"Welcome to Spotlight Utah.
